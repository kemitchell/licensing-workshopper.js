A copy of the MIT license, a copyright notice, and a little metadata
are fine for small, hobby projects. But when more than one person
contributes to a project, each contributor might have rights in their
work. It's important for each person to license their contributions.

If the original author licensed their work MIT, it's simplest for other
contributors to license their work MIT, too. Many developers expect this
when they send a patch to a project that already has an open-source
license. But law courts may or may not respect that expectation, so
it helps to create a record in the project showing that each author
licenses their work under the same terms. It's hard to go back and get
that clarification from contributors after the fact.

It's easy to update an MIT-licensed npm package for multiple
contributors.

1. In the `LICENSE` file, change:

       Copyright (c) Anna Developer

   to:

       Copyright (c) Anna Developer and contributors

2. Create an `AUTHORS` file with lines like:

       # The following contributors license their work under the terms
       # in the LICENSE file.
       Anna Developer <anna@example.com> (https://example.com)

   npm will automatically add everyone listed in an `AUTHORS` file to
   its `contributors` metadata for your package when you publish.

3. When a new contributor sends a pull request to your project, ask them
   to add their name to the `AUTHORS` file and license their
   contribution MIT.

Follow steps 1 and 2 for an MIT-licensed package.

Then run `$title verify` in the package's directory.
